# Churn Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various customer attributes, and the goal is to predict whether a customer will leave the service (`Exited = 1`) or stay (`Exited = 0`).

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- **Demographic Data**: Age, Gender, Geography
- **Financial Information**: Credit Score, Balance, Estimated Salary
- **Customer Activity**: Number of Products, Active Membership, Credit Card Usage

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis
   - Churn trends

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Running the Project
```bash
# Clone repository (if applicable)
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/churn-analysis.git
cd churn-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python main.py
```

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Feature importance analysis shows that **Age, Number of Products, and Credit Score** are significant predictors of churn.
- The **Random Forest model** performed best with an accuracy of ~85%.
- Customers with a single product and low activity are more likely to churn.

## 📌 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance
- Implementation of deep learning models
- Deployment of the model as an API
